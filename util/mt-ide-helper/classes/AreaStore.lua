--- `AreaStore` is a data structure to calculate intersections of 3D cuboid volumes and points.
--- Despite its name, mods must take care of persisting AreaStore data. They may use the provided load and write functions for this.
--- @class AreaStore
--- @field data string may be used to store and retrieve any mod-relevant information to the specified area.
AreaStore = {}

---@param type_name string|nil optional, forces the internally used API. Possible values: "LibSpatial" (default). When other values are specified, or SpatialIndex is not available, the custom Minetest functions are used.
---@return AreaStore Returns a new AreaStore instance
function AreaStore:AreaStore(type_name) end

---@param id              any     type not specified in docs
---@param include_corners boolean whether to include corner info in return table or not
---@param include_data    boolean whether to include data info in return table or not
---@return nil|boolean|table Returns the area information about the specified ID.
---Returned values are either of these:
---```lua
---nil  -- Area not found
---true -- Without `include_corners` and `include_data`
---{
---	min = pos, max = pos -- `include_corners == true`
---	data = string        -- `include_data == true`
---}
---```
function AreaStore:get_area(id, include_corners, include_data) end

---Returns all areas as table, indexed by the area ID.
---Table values: see get_area.
function AreaStore:get_areas_for_pos(pos, include_corners, include_data) end

---Returns all areas that contain all nodes inside the area specified bycorner1 and corner2 (inclusive).
---accept_overlap: if true, areas are returned that have nodes in common (intersect) with the specified area.
---Returns the same values as get_areas_for_pos.
function AreaStore:get_areas_in_area(corner1, corner2, accept_overlap, include_corners, include_data) end

---inserts an area into the store.
---
---Returns the new area's ID, or nil if the insertion failed.
---    The (inclusive) positions corner1 and corner2 describe the area.
---    data is a string stored with the area.
---    id (optional): will be used as the internal area ID if it is a unique number between 0 and 2^32-2.
function AreaStore:insert_area(corner1, corner2, data, id) end

---Requires SpatialIndex, no-op function otherwise.
--- Reserves resources for count many contained areas to improve efficiency when working with many area entries. Additional areas can still be inserted afterwards at the usual complexity.
function AreaStore:reserve(count) end

---removes the area with the given id from the store, returns success.
function AreaStore:remove_area(id) end

---sets params for the included prefiltering cache. Calling invalidates the cache, so that its elements have to be newly generated.
---
---    params is a table with the following fields:
---
---    enabled = boolean, -- Whether to enable, default true block_radius = int, -- The radius (in nodes) of the areas the cache -- generates prefiltered lists for, minimum 16, -- default 64 limit = int, -- The cache size, minimum 20, default 1000 * to_string(): Experimental. Returns area store serialized as a (binary) string. * to_file(filename): Experimental. Like to_string(), but writes the data to a file. * from_string(str): Experimental. Deserializes string and loads it into the AreaStore. Returns success and, optionally, an error message. * from_file(filename): Experimental. Like from_string(), but reads the data from a file.
function AreaStore:set_cache_params(params) end
